# Data Analysis Nanodegree Projects
## By Nacer KROUDIR

This repository contains 3 projects related to the [Data Analysis Nanodegree](https://nanodegree.alxafrica.com/courses/data-analyst/) 
program delivered by **Udacity** and **ALX**. The projects are focused on different aspects of data analysis, including data wrangling, 
data visualization, and exploratory data analysis.

## [Project 1: Investigate TMDB Movies dataset](https://github.com/NacerKROUDIR/Data-Analysis-Exploring-Different-Datasets/tree/8c27e5417ba6cf81e08eb07087e927270f8c9066/Project%20Investigate%20TMDB%20Movies%20dataset)

In this project, you can find a jupyter notebook of the data analysis and the corresponding dataset. The purpose of this project is to familiarise 
yourself with the data analysis process and the jupyter notebook workflow.

## [Project 2: Data Wrangling for WeRateDogs Twitter account](https://github.com/NacerKROUDIR/Data-Analysis-Exploring-Different-Datasets/tree/8c27e5417ba6cf81e08eb07087e927270f8c9066/Project%20Data%20Wrangling%20for%20WeRateDogs%20Twitter%20account)

this project is centered around the **data wrangling** process, from **data gathering** through different means (link, API...), passing by 
**data assessing** and **data cleaning**. I worked with a messy dataset and performed data wrangling techniques to clean and transform the data into 
a usable format. I used tools such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to explore, clean, and visualize the data. I made two reports: 
- The first report is highlighting the problems I found on the datasets and the steps I went through in data cleaning.
- The second report communicates the key findings and results obtained in the data analysis.

Both reports are included as `.pdf` in the project folder.

## [Project 3: Data Visualization for Ford GoBike Dataset](https://github.com/NacerKROUDIR/Data-Analysis-Exploring-Different-Datasets/tree/8c27e5417ba6cf81e08eb07087e927270f8c9066/Project%20Data%20Visualization%20for%20Ford%20GoBike%20Dataset)

This project focused on creating effective data visualizations using Python libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `folium`. I used the skills 
and knowledge learned in the program to create visualizations that effectively communicate insights from Ford GoBike dataset. The project includes an 
elegant presentation of the key findings made in jupyter notebook.
