# Project#2 Data Wrangeling for WeRateDogs Tweets
### Tasks
The project involves the following steps:
1. Gathering data, including:
    * Directly (available in the Resources section of your classroom or linked in step 1).
    * Using Twitter API to query WeRateDogs Tweets data.
    * Using `requests` library and the URL for the data.
2. Assessing data quality and tidiness.
3. Cleaning the data.
4. Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the cleaned data.
5. Documenting the data wrangling process in a Jupyter Notebook, and presenting the results through analysis and visualization.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the tweet archive of the popular Twitter account @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. The account humorously rates people's dogs and has over 9.3 million followers (as of February 2023). The ratings typically have a denominator of 10, but the numerators are often greater than 10 (e.g. 11/10, 12/10). The data will be wrangled, analyzed, and visualized using Python and its libraries.
