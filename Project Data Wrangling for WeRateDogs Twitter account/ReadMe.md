# Project#2 Data Wrangeling for WeRateDogs Tweets
### Tasks
The project involves the following steps:
- Gathering data, including:
1- Directly (available in the Resources section of your classroom or linked in step 1).
2- using Twitter API to query WeRateDogs Tweets data.
3- using `requests` library and the URL for the data.
- Assessing data quality and tidiness.
- Cleaning the data.
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the cleaned data.
- Documenting the data wrangling process in a Jupyter Notebook, and presenting the results through analysis and visualization.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the tweet archive of the popular Twitter account @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. The account humorously rates people's dogs and has over 9.3 million followers (as of February 2023). The ratings typically have a denominator of 10, but the numerators are often greater than 10 (e.g. 11/10, 12/10). The data will be wrangled, analyzed, and visualized using Python and its libraries.
